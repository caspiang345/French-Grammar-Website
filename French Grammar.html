      What is verb conjugation?
    </h2>
    <q> Grammar is to a writer what anatomy is to a sculptor, or the scales to a musician.  You may loathe it, it may bore you, but nothing will replace it, and once mastered it will support you like a rock.

      <strong> Verb conjugation </strong> is when you take a verb in the <em> infinitive form </em> and change it to the proper form for the subject.  In most languages, there are 6 different subjects: singular and plural 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person.  Without proper knoledge of the subject, you'll be as lost as a moneky in space when trying to speak French, so let's get into it.  Below is a table of the 6 subjects in English.
    </p>
    <table>
      <th>
        Englsih
      </th>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Singular
        </td>
        <td>
          Plural
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          I
        </td>
        <td>
          We
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          You
        </td>
        <td>
          Y'all
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          He/She/It
        </td>
        <td>
          They
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The table above might not make sense at first.  That is because to us English speakers who have words such as "you" and "they" which can act as both the singular and plural subjects (The sentence "You will do this for them," does not specify how many people "you," or how many people "them," could be talking about,) to distinguish the langauge in this format is pointless.  However, it makes sense when we look below at the French equivilant.

      Why is verb conjugation important?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Verb conjugation allowx you to transform words from simply abstract things into a form that is applicable in a sentence.  While far less common than in French, English conjugates verbs too!  We're going to use to infinitive verb <em> to be</em>/<em>etre</em> to demonstrate this concept.

      While four of the six subjects use the same form of <em> to be</em>, that being <em> are</em>, there is still a distinction for some of the subjects.  As we will see below, this is not the case with French.

     As opposed to English, the French have a different form of <em>etre</em> for every subject.  This is why verb conjugation is important for learning French; while it is something that us English speakers have hardly any need for, it is a necessity for the French.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Present tense conjugation for the three main verb types
    </h2>
    <p>
      To start off with, there are three main verb types which accompany the vast majority of French verbs.  Those verbs are those that end in -er, -re, and -ir.  We will look at their present tense forms below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-Er_verbs">
      -Er verbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      -Er verbs make up 90% of the total number of verbs in French.  Therefore, learning how to conjugate this set of verbs is crucial for understanding a huge part of French.  It's important to remember that even though these words end in -er in the infinitive, they are pronounced not as though they have an 'e' and an 'r', but simply an 'e' pronounced like "aye".  Example of -er verbs include:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Manger
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To eat
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Nager
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To swim
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Changer
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To change
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Parler
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To speak
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Acheter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To buy
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="-Re_verbs">
      -Re verbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      This group of verbs is pronounced in the infinitive with an ending that sounds like the first part of the word rou-gh (ex. com-prawnd-ruh).  Examples of -re verbs include:
    </p>
        <dl>
      <dt>
        Rendre
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To give back
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Prendre
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To take
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Attendre
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To wait
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Vendre
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To sell
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Apprendre
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To learn
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="-Ir verbs">
      -Ir_verbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Examoples of -ir verbs include:
    </p>
        <dl>
      <dt>
        Choisir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To choose
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Remplir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To fill
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Abolir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To abolish
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Agir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To act
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Finir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To finish
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="Irregular">
      Irregular Verbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Despite the promenince of these 3 structures for verb conjugation, there are some verbs that do not follow the rules.  These verbs are called irregular verbs.  What you might not expect is that some of these irregular verbs are both some of the most commonly used verbs and a lot end in either -er, -re, or -ir with just a slightly differnet ending for a couple of the subjects.  Examples of irregular verbs include:
    </p>
        <dl>
      <dt>
        Aller
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To go
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Avoir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To have
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Dire
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To say
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Faire
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To do
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Pouvoir
      </dt>
      <dd>
        To be able to
      </dd>
    </dl>
